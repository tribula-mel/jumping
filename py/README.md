# Jumping Jack reimplementation for modern systems

The idea is to mimic the original game as much as possible. The Python3 version
goes long way down this path. Graphics are original, as well as all the
movement.
I tested the game on a Linux installation, while my son Mikston tested on
Windows. Here come the Windows instructions by him.

## Windows steps

1. Install Python3 (python.org)
2. Run the following command:
   pip install pygame

3. Pick a directory where you want to clone the project. Open a command prompt
   to that location and run:
   git clone “https://github.com/tribula-mel/chuck.git”

4. In the command prompt cd into chuck directory and then into py directory
5. To run the game:
   python main.py
