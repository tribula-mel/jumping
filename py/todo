[ ] left/right edges movement
    this is only partially fixed
[ ] polish the game
[ ] bug: no fall through when at certain line and possibly after crashing

[ ] consider
    [ ] separating events and drawing into two threads
    [ ] the events could be represented with an event queue; there could be
        events for keyboard presses, time pass, collision, game over, next
        level, fall through; the main consumer the draw thread
    [ ] draw thread could be suppported by a queue as well; an element could
        have a sprite to update, its new position
    [ ] in any case it would be good to separate new sprite position from
        the current one
