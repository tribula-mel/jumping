[ ] polish the game
    [x] introduce delay for different jack sequences
    [ ] line crash changes the background colour

[ ] consider
    [ ] separating events and drawing into two threads
    [ ] the events could be represented with an event queue;
        there could be events for keyboard presses, time pass,
        collision, game over, next level, fall through;
        the main consumer the draw thread
    [ ] draw thread could be suppported by a queue as well;
        an element could have a sprite to update,
        its new position
    [ ] in any case it would be good to separate new sprite
        position from the current one
